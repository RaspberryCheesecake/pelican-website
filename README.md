#pelican-website
Source code for my website generator.
Includes all files needed to get Pelican to rebuild the site with the command
````
make html
````
If you want to try a change to the website out locally, run the
``` develop_server.sh``` script in the shell to get an updating copy
hosted locally at ```localhost:8000```

To start and stop this local server, do
````
./develop_server.sh start
./develop_server.sh stop
````
