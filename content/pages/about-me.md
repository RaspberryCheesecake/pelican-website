Summary: About

## I Love Making Beautiful Things!

I am an engineer and programmer based in Leeds. 

I studied Manufacturing Engineering (MET) at Cambridge University, specialising in additive manufacturing. So far in my career I've had the chance to be involved in all sorts of interesting projects, from cutting edge medical technologies, to working with huge legacy codebases, automating the build process for a popular 3D printing application. Python was my first love and is still my favourite language. When it comes to web dev I'll always enjoy using the tools built by my old friends at [Anvil](https://www.anvil.works). These days I work for [Literature Cambridge](https://www.literaturecambridge.co.uk/) as a web developer and marketing specialist.

In my spare time I enjoy playing interesting German board games, tinkering with Raspberry Pi, DM'ing D&D campaigns, writing poetry and reading great science fiction.
