Summary: About

## I Love Making Beautiful Things!

I am an Engineer based in Cambridge. I currently work at [PA Consulting](http://www.paconsulting.com/services/technology-innovation/) in the Software and Controls group. I started out in the Mechanical Engineering group but realised that what I most enjoy is writing the code that makes factory equipment work - not designing the motors or robotic arms themselves.

I studied Manufacturing Engineering (MET) at Cambridge University. My Master's thesis describes how I created a set of tools to teach best practice in design for additive manufacture. As a consultant I've had the chance to be involved in all sorts of interesting projects, from dispensing soup to printing with chocolate, detergent and cheese! I love all things 3D printing and particularly relish writing code to make industrial robots and printers obey me. My programming experience is primarily in Python and PLC code.

In my spare time I enjoy playing interesting German board games, DM'ing D&D campaigns and reading great science fiction.
