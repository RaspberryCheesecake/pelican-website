Summary: About

## I Love Making Beautiful Things!

I am an Engineer and Programmer based in Leeds. I most recently worked at [Anvil](https://anvil.works) as a Developer Advocate, helping developers to build full stack web apps with nothing but Python.

I studied Manufacturing Engineering (MET) at Cambridge University. My Master's thesis describes how I created a set of tools to teach best practice in design for additive manufacture. So far in my career I've had the chance to be involved in all sorts of interesting projects, from cutting edge medical technologies, to working with huge legacy code bases, to dispensing soup to printing with chocolate, detergent and cheese! I love all things 3D printing and robotics and particularly relish writing code to make industrial robots and printers obey me. Python was my first love and is still my favourite language.

In my spare time I enjoy playing interesting German board games, playing with Raspberry Pi, DM'ing D&D campaigns and reading great science fiction.
