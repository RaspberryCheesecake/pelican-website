Summary: About

## I Love Making Beautiful Things!

I am an Engineer based in Cambridge. I currently work at [Cambridge Medical Robotics](www.cmedrobotics.com) as a Python developer, working on tools to support the manufacture of our surgical robots.

I studied Manufacturing Engineering (MET) at Cambridge University. My Master's thesis describes how I created a set of tools to teach best practice in design for additive manufacture. So far in my career 've had the chance to be involved in all sorts of interesting projects, from cutting edge medical technologies to dispensing soup to printing with chocolate, detergent and cheese! I love all things 3D printing and robotics and particularly relish writing code to make industrial robots and printers obey me. My programming experience is primarily with Python and PLC code.

In my spare time I enjoy playing interesting German board games, DM'ing D&D campaigns and reading great science fiction.
