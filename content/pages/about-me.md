Summary: About

## I Love Making Beautiful Things!

I am an Engineer based in Cambridge. I currently work at [Stratasys](www.stratasys.com) as a C++, Python and Typescript developer, working on tools to support our [GrabCAD Print](https://grabcad.com/print) software.

I studied Manufacturing Engineering (MET) at Cambridge University. My Master's thesis describes how I created a set of tools to teach best practice in design for additive manufacture. So far in my career I've had the chance to be involved in all sorts of interesting projects, from cutting edge medical technologies to dispensing soup to printing with chocolate, detergent and cheese! I love all things 3D printing and robotics and particularly relish writing code to make industrial robots and printers obey me. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing interesting German board games, playing with Raspberry Pi, DM'ing D&D campaigns and reading great science fiction.
