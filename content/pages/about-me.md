Summary: About

## I Love Making Beautiful Things!

I am an Engineer and Programmer based in Leeds. 

I studied Manufacturing Engineering (MET) at Cambridge University, specialising in additive manufacturing. So far in my career I've had the chance to be involved in all sorts of interesting projects, from cutting edge medical technologies, to working with huge legacy codebases, to dispensing soup and printing with chocolate, detergent and cheese! I love all things 3D printing and robotics and particularly relish writing code to make industrial robots and printers obey me. Python was my first love and is still my favourite language. I most recently worked at [Anvil](https://anvil.works) as a Developer Advocate, helping developers to build full stack web apps with nothing but Python.

In my spare time I enjoy playing interesting German board games, tinkering with Raspberry Pi, DM'ing D&D campaigns, writing poetry and reading great science fiction.
