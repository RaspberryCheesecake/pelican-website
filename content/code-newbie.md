*I spoke at a virtual conference!*

I was recently invited to speak at Code Newbie's [CodeLand 2022](https://community.codenewbie.org/t/codeland22). I had a wonderful time at the virtual conference and got the chance to speak with some great people including experts in the field (I was part of a roundtable discussion with [Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower), I was starstruck!). Code Newbie's community is a lovely welcoming place for everyone, especially folks who are just getting started in software professionally. I'm definitely interested to go along again next year.

If you'd like to watch my talk, it's still available on demand [here](https://community.codenewbie.org/codeland2022/on-demand-talk-how-i-tracked-my-pregnancy-with-python-emojis-4cef)
