*They also serve who only stand and watch construction*

I'm delighted to say that I recently won a writing challenge, 'Il Campionato Mondiale Di Umari'. 

An 'Umarell' is a lighthearted way of referring to elderly men who like to watch construction sites. The practice is apparently so common in Italy that special holes are often included in fences around roadworks to make it easier for these retired guys to enjoy their favourite pastime. But ogling construction work isn't just for retired people! Spencer Wright at Scope of Work explains -

>To umarell is to take an interest in the built environment – the environment that our species creates, and in which most of us spend most of our time. An umarell turns their attention to that environment's creation, taking time to appreciate the materials, machines, and muscles from which it emerges. Umarelling is an act of respect and appreciation, and it is for this reason that I am proud to announce the inaugural Campionato Mondiale di Umari – the 2024 World Umarelling Championship.

 The championship had three categories: notes, sketches and open text. I won in the open text category with an original poem and was delighted to be sent my own official 'Umarelling' notebook and a T-shirt which I'll wear with pride.

The challenge was organised by my favourite design and engineering newsletter, [Scope of Work](https://www.scopeofwork.net/), which I've been following ever since I was an undergrad in Manufacturing Engineering. Spencer Wright's newsletter is always one of the things I look forward to most in my inbox. If you like deep dives into [how we keep food fresh](https://www.scopeofwork.net/frostbitten/), the history of [soap in a box](https://www.scopeofwork.net/selling-sunshine/), or understanding what it takes to [put a flamingo inside a beachball](https://www.scopeofwork.net/the-flamingoes/) you'll definitely enjoy Scope of Work. I can't count the number of times it's introduced me to my latest obsession.
